	<p><b>Perfume (UK: /ˈpɜːfjuːm/, US: /pərˈfjuːm/; French: parfum) is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma
compounds, fixatives and solvents, usually in liquid form, used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and 
living-spaces an agreeable scent.[1] The 1939 Nobel Laureate for Chemistry, Leopold Ružička stated in 1945 that "right from
the earliest days of scientific chemistry up to the present time perfumes have substantially contributed to the development
of organic chemistry as regards methods, systematic classification, and theory."[2]
Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human civilizations. Modern
perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarin,
which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics.The word
perfume derives from the Latin perfumare, meaning "to smoke through".[3] Perfumery, as the art of making perfumes, began in
ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization and possibly Ancient China.[4] It was further refined by the
Romans and the Muslims.</b></p>
